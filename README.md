## About Me

I build cybersecurity environments that look and behave like real enterprise networks — segmented, monitored, attacked, and defended.  
My work focuses on **detection engineering**, **network security architecture**, **exploit replication**, and the systems knowledge required to understand security from both sides of the wire.

Between RapidAscent’s intensive training pipeline and my independent lab development, my day-to-day revolves around designing networks, generating meaningful telemetry, analyzing attacks, and building the defensive logic to detect them accurately.

## Lab Summary  
(Representative of cumulative work across RapidAscent, PacketTracer, and independent research.)

- **60+ virtual machines deployed & maintained**  
- **50+ PacketTracer network simulations designed**  
- **30+ VLANs and segmented environments engineered**  
- **20+ exploit simulations with documentation**  
- **Multiple enterprise-style logging pipelines constructed**  
- **Hundreds of hours across structured training & lab development**

These environments are built to mirror realistic network behavior — noisy, imperfect, and full of opportunities to learn how attackers move and how defenders respond.
