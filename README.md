## About Me

I build cybersecurity environments that look and behave like real enterprise networks. My work combines detection engineering, network security architecture, exploit replication, and telemetry analysis. I focus on designing realistic topologies, generating high quality log data, understanding attack techniques, and building the defensive logic required to detect them.

I also spend significant time designing accurate network diagrams in Visio and draw.io to model complex architectures. Visual clarity matters when building systems worth defending.

## Lab Summary  
(Representative of combined work across network engineering, security analysis, and ongoing research.)

- 60+ virtual machines deployed across multiple hypervisors  
- 50+ Packet Tracer network simulations designed and configured  
- 30+ segmented VLAN environments engineered  
- 20+ documented exploit simulations  
- Multiple end to end logging pipelines constructed  
- Extensive time invested in designing realistic network architectures and detection use cases  

My goal is to build systems that reflect how real networks operate and then study how attackers move through them and how defenders can detect those movements with precision.
